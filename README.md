## Bulbasaur
Specializing in frontloaded value, Bulbasaur uses a vast array of debuffs such as poison, vulnerability, the newly introduced leech seed as well as many others to overwhelm his enemies. Fast way to scale with strength to crush enemies with the help of multi hits. And his defense consists of healing his wounds instead of blocking.
He is the simplest character.

## Charmander
Burn is a special debuff and Charmander's best tool. Capable of negating an enemy’s attacks or to transform it into a powerful damaging tool, burn is at the center of Charmander’s kit. With this he also tends to exhaust his own deck to fuel more powerful abilities. And the modified claw cards he has allow him to stand his own in terms of damage.
He is a rather simple character. 

## Squirtle
Master of card manipulation, Squirtle uses Scrying, Discarding and Drawing to make the most out of every hand. But access his most powerful tools he must create statuses and other cards. Finally with his power he relies of temporary strength to scale. Combining all those tools makes him one of the strongest explorers.
He is quite intricate.

## Pikachu
Capable of generating Lightning orbs and swapping stances, Pikachu’s main mechanic revolves around the Charge-Meter. The charge-meter is a gauge that allows the players to create powerful effects if their sequencing is optimized.
Pikachu is the hardest out of all the characters.
