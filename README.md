# StS-Default Mod Base

Welcome to this extremely over-commented Slay the Spire modding base. 

This is a minimal "default clean slate" for creating Slay the spire mods. 

Use it to make your own mod of any type - If you want to add any standard in-game content (character, cards, relics, events, etc.), this is a good starting point.

It features 1 character (the Default) with a minimal set of things: 1 card of each type, 1 debuff, 1 relic, etc.

If you're new to modding, you basically *need* the BaseMod wiki for whatever you wish to add, and you can work your way thought it with this base. Another very important thing is to look at other mods (get them from their github!), as well as the base-game code, and see how they do things.

This base itself isn't going to help you code or anything!! Nor does it provide basic Java learning - if you need that go through the codeacademy free java course! While I have been putting comments about what does what, this is just a nice starting point if you need a place to start learning from that's not an absolute empty canvas, or an overly-complicated, difficult to understand mod. But you still need to learn how the in-game code works and how to piece things together on your own. (i.e. this base will show you where to put the code for double-tap, but not what it is/how to write it. Look up the actual cards and backward-engineer them for that.)

Feel free to use this in any way you like, of course. 

If you have any issues or you want to recommend and/or add something to the mod that you feel would be helpful, feel free to submit an issue or a PR!

Happy modding!
